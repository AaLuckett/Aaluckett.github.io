        <li>How did I fix it? I took it apart step by step, by looking online and finally spotted the mistake and fixed it.</li>

      <h3>Thinking About Problem-Solving</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode: Sometimes it's helpful, but it can be hard to turn into real code.</li>
        <li>Trying Something: I'm good at this; just testing things out sometimes works.</li>
        <li>Rubber Ducky Method: It's okay; I can see how explaining the problem to someone/something can help.</li>
        <li>Reading Error Messages: I'm poor at this; error messages tell me what's wrong.</li>
        <li>Console.logging: I'm ok at this; it helps me see what's happening.</li>
        <li>Googling: I'm confident; google has lots of answers.</li>
        <li>Asking Peers for Help: I'm okay with it, I'm not afraid to do it but rather get there myself.</li>
        <li>Asking Coaches for Help: I'm confident; coaches know a lot.</li>
        <li>Getting Better with Reflection: I'm getting better at this; thinking about my problem-solving helps me learn.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Thinking About Asking for Help</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Once, I didn't want to ask for help because I wanted to show I could do it alone and thought it would look bad to ask.</li>
        <li>Now, I know it's okay to ask for help when needed. Next time, I'll try remember it's not a bad thing.</li>
      </ul>
