          <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
          <p class="question"> What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
          <p class="answer">"Emotional intelligence (EI or EQ for "emotional quotient") is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, 
              evaluate, and use emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively.”
          </p>
          <p class="answer"> There are five key elements to EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, 
            empathy, and social skills. People with high EI can identify how they are feeling, what those feelings mean, 
            and how those emotions impact their behavior and in turn, other people. Its a little harder to “manage” the emotions of other people - you can’t control how someone else feels or behaves. 
            But if you can identify the emotions behind their behavior, you’ll have a better understanding of where they are coming from and how to best interact with them. 
              </p>
          <p class="question">How is it different to IQ (Intelligence Quotient)?</p>
          <p class="answer">Intelligence Quotient or IQ is a number obtained from standardized intelligence test, which represents an individual's ability of logical reasoning.
             EQ refers to an individual's level of emotional intelligence, which is represented by scores obtained in a standardized test.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
             The major differences between IQ and EQ are explained in detail in the following points:
             <br><br>
             1. An individual’s level of emotional intelligence, which is represented by scores obtained in the standardized test, is called Emotional Quotient or EQ. Intelligence Quotient or IQ is a number obtained from standardised intelligence test, which represents an individual’s ability of logical reasoning.
             <br> <br>
             2. A person’s success in school depends on his IQ level, whereas a person’s EQ level reflects his success in real life.
             <br> <br>
             3. EQ measures an individual’s social and emotional competencies or one’s ability to recognise one’s own and other person’s emotional expression. Conversely, IQ measures a person’s academic competency and reasoning ability.
             <br> <br>
             4. Emotional Quotient is acquired and improved. As opposed to intelligence quotient is an ability you are born with.
             <br> <br>
             5. A person with good EQ can recognise, control and express one’s own emotion’s, perceive and assess other’s emotions. On the contrary, a person with a high IQ can learn, understand and implement knowledge, and possesses logical reasoning and abstract thinking.
             <br> <br>
             6. High emotional intelligence can be seen in leaders, captains, managers and people with social challenges. Unlike, Intelligence quotient identifies people with high intellect, common sense, mental challenges, etc

          </p>
    
          <p class="question">Why is EQ important?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            <br>
            1. EQ has a greater impact on success than other factors.
            Some people say that your IQ can land you a job, but it is the lack of emotional intelligence and social intelligence in you that will get you fired. It is believed that your IQ accounts for only 20% of your success in life. The other 80% is determined by your emotional intelligence and social intelligence.
            <br> <br>
            2. The ability to delay gratification is a primary indicator of future success.
            Delayed gratification is the top predictor of future success. People who are able to pay the price today and delay the rewards are much more likely to succeed in life. Unfortunately we have become a nation that seeks instant gratification. This shows up in our everyday lives in the foods we choose to eat, the buy-now-pay-later way of life, our difficulty in
            <br> <br>
             3. High EQ leads to healthy relationships with others.
            Our emotional skills have a direct and important bearing on our relationships with others. We need to understand our feelings, where they come from, and how to properly express them. We will not maintain healthy relationships unless we can control our emotions, communicate our feelings in a constructive manner, and understand the feelings of others.
            <br> <br>
             4. Emotional health impacts physical health.
            There is a direct connection between our emotional health and our physical health. If our lives are filled with stress, our physical health suffers. It has been estimated that well over 80% of our health problems are stress-related. We experience stress primarily because we are not comfortable emotionally. We need to understand the link between our emotional health and our physical health.
