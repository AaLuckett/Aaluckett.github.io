Kia ora everyone, My name is Alex and I currently live in Golden Bay, which is
at the top of the South Island. ðŸŒž I originally come from Oxford, England and
visited Aotearoa/NZ on a working holiday visa. Today I have applied to become a
permanent resident (ðŸ¥³ ). In terms of my values and identity, I believe I get my
core values from my family: loyalty and trust. My identity comes from all the
experiences I have had, good and bad. I am attending Dev Academy to up-skill
myself for the tech industry. Just over 10 months ago I joined a small start up
business after being asked by my friend (now boss)! He has previously attended
the Dev Academy and wanted me to have the same experience/skills. I worry I
wonâ€™t be able to do my job even after the bootcamp but Iâ€™m here to try my
hardest. Look forward to meeting everyone along the way. ðŸ‘‹
