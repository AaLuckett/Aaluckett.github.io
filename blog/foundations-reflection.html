      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I've learned that my ego can sometimes hinder my progress in programming. It's essential to be open to the idea that making mistakes is part of the learning process.</li>
          <li>I've discovered that I have a tendency to rush through coding challenges to prove my abilities, which can lead to errors and missed learning opportunities. Slowing down is crucial.</li>
          <li>I've realized that patience and resilience are key qualities in programming. It's okay to face difficulties and setbacks; the important thing is to keep trying and learning from them.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>Values guide my decision-making in programming.</li>
          <li>Empathy helps me understand/collaborate effectively with team members.</li>
          <li>Self-awareness is crucial in recognizing my strengths and weaknesses. It allows me to focus on areas where I need improvement and seek help or resources when necessary.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
        I was surprised by how much personal growth and self-reflection are intertwined with programming. It's not just about writing code but also about understanding myself and working effectively with others.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
        The most challenging aspect was confronting my own ego and accepting that I don't have to know everything. It can be humbling to ask for help or admit when you don't understand something fully.
          </li>
        </ul>  
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
        Focusing on core learning in a programming school is essential because it builds a strong foundation. These skills will help individuals not only become better programmers but also better team members and problem solvers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The time spent on core learning is not a waste but a valuable investment. While programming skills are essential, core learning enhances one's ability to apply those skills effectively. It's a balance that ultimately makes you a more well-rounded and successful developer.
