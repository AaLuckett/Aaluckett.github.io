      <p>My primary strengths are problem solving and determination to do well in this course and in life. 
        <br> I think these skills will keep going throughout this course, even when I have moments of anxiety/fear of failing.
      </p>
      <p>My limitations surround my confidence in reading and writing. I found this particular task difficult; 
        <br> struggle to write blogs like this and get my thoughts down onto a page. I have to make sure I understand the questions and tasks I have been given clearly, otherwise I feel like I can go down a rabbit hole and end up needing to restart.
      </p>
      <p>I come from a very close knit family. My Mum & Dad have been together for 40 years and I am the youngest of their 4 kids. 
        <br> Throughout my life I have been influenced greatly by the values that have been shared by my family. 
        <br> I was raised watching my parents go through some hard times but always remain loyal to each other.
        <br> We also trust each other deeply. Trust is something I give to everyone initially but once that trust is broken 
        I have always found it hard to look at that person in the same light. 
        I think trust is an amazing value to have and when there is trust it can stop so many negative emotions that can consume your life. 
        I also highly value empathy and compassion. These can often be misunderstood for weaknesses but I see it as massive positive. 
        To have empathy and compassion for someone or something is endearing, I think it shows that you care enough to try and understand
        what other people are going through.

      <p>Within the last 18 months I became a coach of a local men’s football team. 
        Originally I joined with the aim of meeting new people and getting to play with a team. 
        After a few weeks we didn’t have a coach and only 6 players and my natural leadership skills took over. 
      </p>
      <p>I started coaching the players I had and by the end of the season we had came 2nd in the league. 
        During this time I had came across many challenges including having to make some difficult and ethical choices.
      </p>
      <p>At the beginning of our first season, 
        I was unsure of our numbers and so I had asked some younger lads to play and boost the numbers in our team. 
        I struggled with some older players not communicating to me about their availability and turning up to games at the last minute with the idea that they would get more game time because of their experience.
      </p>
      <p>I did not feel like it was moral to choose the less committed players for game time, 
        over others who had put time and effort into their practices. 
        I spent a lot of time explaining this philosophy to everyone, as it rarely matters how good any individual is on the day, 
        it’s how the team functions as a whole that is the most important.
      </p>
      <p>I carried this into the next season, where our numbers increased from 11 in the previous year to 16. 
        I had to balance to try and keep all the players happy as well as manage the games from a strategic 
        point of view so that we could do the best we could do.
      </p>
      <p>We ended the season again 2nd but winning 10 out of 12 games. 
        I feel proud of the impact I had within the team, and the values that I tried to instil were carried on. 
        I have stepped down as coach for the next season, and am confident that I’ve left the team in a better place.
