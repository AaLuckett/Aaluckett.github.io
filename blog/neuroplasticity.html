          <p class="question">What is Neuroplasticiy? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Neuroplasticity is like your brain's superpower to change and adapt.
            It means your brain can learn new things, recover from injuries, and
            get better at stuff you practice. It's like a muscle that gets
            stronger when you use it, and it works your whole life. So, you can
            always learn and improve, no matter how old you are!
          </p>
          <p class="question">What is Growth Mindset?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            A growth mindset is when you believe you can get better at something
            if you try and work hard. It's like thinking, "I can learn and
            improve." Instead of saying, "I can't do it," you say, "I can learn
            how to do it." It's a positive way of looking at challenges and helps
            you keep going when things get tough. So, it's all about believing in
            your potential to grow and get better! This is helping me get through
            my self doubt at the start of this course.

          <p class="question">How does it influence learning?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            When you combine neuroplasticity and a growth mindset, you transform
            into a learning champion. You're aware that your brain can adapt, and
            you're filled with the confidence and motivation to embrace new
            challenges and enhance your skills.
